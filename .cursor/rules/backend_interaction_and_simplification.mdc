# Backend Interaction: Acoustic3dSimulation and VocalTract Simplification

This document outlines the analysis of interaction between `[Acoustic3dSimulation.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.h)` (and its `.cpp`) and `[VocalTract.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.h)` (and its `.cpp`), with the primary goal of simplifying `VocalTract` to support a workflow趋势 where `Acoustic3dSimulation` predominantly uses geometry loaded directly from CSV files.

## Current Understanding & Goals

*   **`Acoustic3dSimulation`'s Potential for CSV Input**: Evidence from `[Acoustic3dSimulation.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.h)` (e.g., `extractContoursFromCsvFile` method) and `[Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp)` (log messages mentioning CSV) suggests it can load and process vocal tract geometry directly from CSV files.
*   **`VocalTract`'s Current Role**: `VocalTract` currently serves as a comprehensive, parameter-driven 3D geometric model of the vocal tract. It generates detailed 3D surfaces, calculates a centerline, and derives cross-sectional area functions. `Acoustic3dSimulation` uses `VocalTract*` in methods like `importGeometry` and `solveWaveProblem`.
*   **Simplification Goal**: If `Acoustic3dSimulation` can independently manage CSV-based geometry, the extensive geometric generation capabilities of `VocalTract` (parameterization, 3D surface calculations via `[Surface.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Surface.h)` & `[Splines.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Splines.h)`, centerline/cross-section extraction detailed in `[01-VocalTractGeometryAlgorithms.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/01-VocalTractGeometryAlgorithms.md)`) may become largely redundant for this specific workflow. `VocalTract` could potentially be reduced to a simpler data holder for parameters not covered by CSV or a minimal interface.

## Analysis and Simplification Strategy for `VocalTract`

The process involves:

1.  **Confirming `Acoustic3dSimulation`'s CSV Capabilities**:
    *   Analyze the implementation of `Acoustic3dSimulation::extractContoursFromCsvFile` in `[Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp)` to understand the expected CSV format and what internal geometric representations are populated.
    *   Determine if these representations are sufficient for subsequent simulation steps (`computeMeshAndModes`, `solveWaveProblem`, etc.) without further complex data from a `VocalTract` object.

2.  **Analyzing `VocalTract` Usage by `Acoustic3dSimulation`**:
    *   **`Acoustic3dSimulation::importGeometry(VocalTract* tract)`**: Investigate (e.g., via debug output or static analysis) what data is actually read from the `tract` object if CSV-based geometry has already been loaded or is the preferred source. Does it primarily rely on `tract->getTube()`, `tract->crossSection`, or direct surface data? Or does it just use `tract` to trigger its own CSV loading if a path is provided through `tract`?
    *   **`Acoustic3dSimulation::solveWaveProblem(VocalTract* tract, ...)`**: Determine what, if any, information is extracted from `tract` during the actual simulation phase. This could include:
        *   Boundary condition parameters (e.g., glottal area if not part of the CSV, radiation impedance details).
        *   Material properties (e.g., wall impedance from `tract->tubeSection[i]->Mw, Bw, Kw` if the simulation considers wall vibrations and these are not in the CSV).
        *   Other global acoustic parameters.

3.  **Simplifying `VocalTract` based on Findings**:
    *   **If `Acoustic3dSimulation` can be fully CSV-driven for geometry**: The `VocalTract` class can be significantly stripped down. Functions to be potentially removed/commented out from `[VocalTract.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.cpp)` and their declarations from `[VocalTract.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.h)` include:
        *   Most methods related to parametric control (`param` array manipulation, except perhaps for a few global settings).
        *   The entire shape library system (`shapes` vector, `readShapesXml`, `writeShapesXml`).
        *   Most 3D surface generation logic (`calcSurfaces`, `initLarynx`, `initJaws`, `initVelum`, `calcLips`, `calcTongue`) and dependencies on `[Splines.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Splines.h)` and complex `[Surface.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Surface.h)` usage.
        *   Centerline calculation (`calcCenterLine`) and cross-section profile extraction from surfaces (`getCrossProfiles`, `getCrossSection`).
        *   Many export functions (`saveAsObjFile`, `exportTractContourSvg`, etc.).
    *   **Retained `VocalTract` Functionality (Potentially)**:
        *   A constructor.
        *   A method to load data from a (simplified or pre-processed) CSV if `Acoustic3dSimulation` doesn't do this entirely itself.
        *   Storage for the geometric data in the format `Acoustic3dSimulation` consumes (e.g., a list of `CrossSection2d` objects, or centerline + area function arrays).
        *   Getters for any non-geometric parameters `Acoustic3dSimulation` might still need.
        *   The `getTube()` method might still be needed if other modules like `TdsModel` (if retained) or `TlModel` (if retained) are used and they expect data in that format, but its population would come from CSV rather than internal calculation.

4.  **Iterative Refinement**: Comment out targeted sections of `VocalTract`, recompile, and test with a focus on `Acoustic3dPage` functionality when driven by a CSV file. Debug outputs will be crucial.

## Path to Backend Files (Relative to Workspace Root for .mdc linking)

*   `Acoustic3dSimulation.h`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.h`
*   `Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.cpp`
*   `VocalTract.h`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.h` (assuming restored here for compilation)
*   `VocalTract.cpp`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.cpp` (assuming restored here for compilation)
*   `Data.h`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Data.h`
*   `Data.cpp`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Data.cpp`
*   `Surface.h`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Surface.h`
*   `Splines.h`: `miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Splines.h`
*   Relevant analysis documents in: `miniVTL3D/sources/doc/`

This rule will guide the focused simplification of `VocalTract` while ensuring `Acoustic3dSimulation` remains functional with CSV-based geometry.
