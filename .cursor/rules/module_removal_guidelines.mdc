# Guidelines for Removing Unnecessary C++ Modules in VocalTractLab3D

This document outlines the general process followed to remove non-essential C++ modules (typically GUI dialogs or complex backend features) from the VocalTractLab3D project, aiming to simplify the application. The primary method involves commenting out code related to the target module.

**Core Principle**: Iteratively identify and isolate dependencies, then neutralize them by commenting out code. Test compilation frequently.

## General Steps for Removing a Module (e.g., `TargetDialog`)

1.  **Identify Entry Points and High-Level Usage**:
    *   **`MainWindow`**: This is often the primary integrator. Look for:
        *   `#include "TargetDialog.h"` in `[MainWindow.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.h)`.
        *   Creation of `TargetDialog` instances (e.g., `TargetDialog::getInstance()`, `new TargetDialog()`) in `[MainWindow.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.cpp)` (usually in constructor or `initWidgets`).
        *   Menu item IDs (e.g., `IDM_SHOW_TARGET_DIALOG`) and corresponding `EVT_MENU` entries in the event table.
        *   Event handler functions (e.g., `void MainWindow::OnShowTargetDialog(wxCommandEvent&)`).
    *   **`Application`**: Check `[Application.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Application.cpp)` (especially `OnInit`) for any initialization or direct use of the `TargetDialog`.
    *   **Other UI Components / Pages**: If the module is a sub-component of another page (e.g., a button on `[Acoustic3dPage.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Acoustic3dPage.cpp)` that launches `TargetDialog`), identify those interaction points.

2.  **Initial Commenting Phase - Header & High-Level Calls**:
    *   In the primary integrator (e.g., `[MainWindow.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.h)`), comment out `#include "TargetDialog.h"`.
    *   In the corresponding `.cpp` file (e.g., `[MainWindow.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.cpp)`):
        *   Comment out `TargetDialog` instantiation.
        *   Comment out event handler function declarations (in `.h`) and definitions (in `.cpp`).
        *   Comment out `EVT_MENU` or other event bindings in the event table.
        *   Comment out associated menu/button ID constant definitions.
        *   Comment out any code in `initWidgets` that creates UI elements for this module.
        *   In `OnCloseWindow` (if applicable), comment out calls to `TargetDialog::getInstance()->Close()`.

3.  **Compile and Identify Direct Dependencies**:
    *   Attempt to compile. The compiler will now error on any code that directly used `TargetDialog` types or its members because the header is no longer included.
    *   **Example Error**: `'TargetDialog' was not declared in this scope` or `'targetDialogInstance' has incomplete type`.

4.  **Address Direct Dependencies in Other Files**:
    *   For each error from step 3, navigate to the reported file and line.
    *   Comment out the problematic lines. This often involves:
        *   Calls to `TargetDialog::getInstance()`.
        *   Usage of `TargetDialog*` pointers or references.
        *   Calls to methods of the `TargetDialog` object (e.g., `targetDialog->Refresh()`).
    *   **Commonly Affected Files**:
        *   `[Data.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.cpp)`: If the module interacted with or was managed by the `Data` singleton.
        *   Other dialogs or pages that communicated with `TargetDialog`.

5.  **Iterative Deeper Dependency Removal (If Necessary)**:
    *   If commenting out a call to `TargetDialog::someFunction()` in `[Data.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.cpp)` makes `Data::aWrapperFunction()` no longer functional or necessary, then:
        *   Comment out the implementation of `Data::aWrapperFunction()` in `[Data.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.cpp)`.
        *   Comment out the declaration of `Data::aWrapperFunction()` in `[Data.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.h)`.
        *   Compile again. This will reveal where `Data::aWrapperFunction()` was called (e.g., in `[MainWindow.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.cpp)`).
        *   Comment out those calls in `[MainWindow.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.cpp)`, and potentially the associated UI elements/event handlers in `MainWindow` if they solely relied on this functionality.
    *   Repeat this process figliare out dependencies. The goal is to neutralize all code paths that lead to or rely on the module being removed.

6.  **Handle `#include "TargetDialog.h"` in other files**:
    *   As compilation errors guide you, you may find other `.cpp` files that directly include `TargetDialog.h`. Comment these out.
    *   This will then lead to errors within those files if they use `TargetDialog` types, which need to be commented out as per step 4.

7.  **Final Build System Clean-up (Crucial Post-Compilation Success)**:
    *   Once the project compiles successfully without the module's code (due to commenting), the final step is to prevent the module's source files from being compiled and linked at all.
    *   Edit the build system configuration (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt` or `Makefile`).
    *   Remove `TargetDialog.cpp` (and its header, if explicitly listed) from the list of source files to be compiled.
    *   Perform a clean build (e.g., `make clean && make` or delete the build directory and reconfigure/rebuild with CMake).

## Specific Modules Addressed in This Session (Ongoing):

*   **`VocalTractDialog`**: Followed the general steps. Key impacts were on `MainWindow` for display, `Application` for initialization, `Acoustic3dPage` for receiving its `VocalTractPicture`, and `Data` for some export functions that relied on its picture/state.
*   **`GesturalScore`**: This was a more a backend/data module.
    *   Removed from `[Data.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.h)` (member variable, includes, enum values, function declarations).
    *   Removed/commented implementations in `[Data.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Data.cpp)`.
    *   Removed/commented UI interactions in `[MainWindow.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.h)` and `[MainWindow.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/MainWindow.cpp)` (menu items, event handlers, ID definitions).
    *   Addressed knock-on effects in `[TransitionDialog.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/TransitionDialog.cpp)` which used static methods from `GesturalScore` or relied on `data->gesturalScore`.
    *   Addressed knock-on effects in `[VocalTractLabApi.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTractLabApi.h)` and `[VocalTractLabApi.cpp](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTractLabApi.cpp)` by commenting out API functions related to `GesturalScore`.

*   **`SegmentSequence`**: This module, primarily a front-end to `GesturalScore`, was also removed.
    *   Dependencies in `Data.h`, `Data.cpp`, `MainWindow.h`, `MainWindow.cpp`, and `VocalTractLabApi.h/.cpp` were commented out or removed.
    *   The `AnnotationDialog` which relied on `SegmentSequence` has had its core logic disabled and is pending removal from build.

*   **`AnatomyParams` and `AnatomyParamsDialog`**: These provided high-level anatomical parameter adjustments.
    *   The core logic in `Backend/AnatomyParams.h/.cpp` was not restored.
    *   Dependencies in `Data.h/.cpp` and `MainWindow.h/.cpp` (for `AnatomyParamsDialog`) were commented out.
    *   `AnatomyParamsDialog.cpp` (and its `.h`) were removed/excluded from the build system.

*   **`VocalTract` (Core Geometric Model - Retained, with plan for future simplification)**:
    *   Identified as a core component providing geometric data to `Acoustic3dSimulation`, `TlModel`, and `TdsModel`.
    *   `Data.h` includes `Backend/VocalTract.h` and `Data.cpp` instantiates and uses `VocalTract* data->vocalTract`.
    *   `[Acoustic3dSimulation.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Bak/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.h)` includes `Backend/VocalTract.h` and several key methods (`importGeometry`, `solveWaveProblem`, `extractContours`, `createCrossSections`) take a `VocalTract*` argument.
    *   **CSV Import Capability**: It has been noted that `Acoustic3dSimulation` might be able to directly load geometry (centerline and cross-sections) from CSV files (evidenced by `extractContoursFromCsvFile` in `[Acoustic3dSimulation.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Bak/Backend/Acoustic3dSimulation.h)`).
    *   **Planned Simplification Strategy**: If `Acoustic3dSimulation` can use CSV-defined geometry directly, the role of `VocalTract` could be significantly reduced. The plan is to:
        1.  Resolve current compilation errors to get a stable base.
        2.  Investigate how `Acoustic3dSimulation` uses the `VocalTract* tract` argument when CSV data is available/preferred.
        3.  Identify which parts of `VocalTract` (e.g., parametric controls, 3D surface generation via `[Surface.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Bak/Backend/Surface.h)` and `[Splines.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Bak/Backend/Splines.h)`, complex centerline/cross-section calculations from surfaces documented in `[01-VocalTractGeometryAlgorithms.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/01-VocalTractGeometryAlgorithms.md)`, shape libraries, most export functions) become redundant.
        4.  Refactor `VocalTract` to be a much simpler class, potentially only responsible for loading pre-computed geometry from a specified CSV format and providing minimal necessary data to `Acoustic3dSimulation` that isn't in the CSV.

*   **Core Backend Components (Restored/Retained during initial Backend restoration)**:
    *   `[IirFilter.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/IirFilter.h)`: Implements IIR filters.
    *   `[Signal.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Signal.h)`: Defines basic signal data structures.
    *   `[LfPulse.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/LfPulse.h)`: Implements the LF model for glottal pulse generation (声源模型). Documented in `[07-VowelLfAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/07-VowelLfAnalysis.md)`.
    *   `[TdsModel.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/TdsModel.h)`: Implements a time-domain synthesis model. User decided to keep this for now. Documented in (pending) analysis file.
    *   `[TlModel.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/TlModel.h)`: Implements a frequency-domain transmission line model. Temporarily restored. Documented in (pending) analysis file.
    *   `[VocalTract.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VocalTract.h)`: Core vocal tract geometry model (see above). Restored.
    *   `[Surface.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Surface.h)`: Defines 3D surface representation, crucial for `VocalTract`. Restored. Documented in (pending) analysis file.
    *   `[Splines.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/Splines.h)`: Provides spline classes, fundamental for `VocalTract` geometry. Restored. Documented in (pending) analysis file.
    *   `[SoundLib.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/SoundLib.h)`: Cross-platform audio I/O library. Essential for hearing any synthesized output. Documented in `[09-SoundLibAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/09-SoundLibAnalysis.md)`. Restored.
    *   **Decision Rationale**: These components are being restored iteratively to resolve compilation errors. Their long-term necessity in a maximally simplified, CSV-driven `Acoustic3dSimulation`-focused version will be re-evaluated later. Some (like `Signal.h`, `SoundLib.h`, `VocalTract.h` in some form) are almost certainly indispensable.

*   **Glottis Models (Restored/Retained)**:
    *   Includes `[TwoMassModel.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/TwoMassModel.h)` (documented in `[02-TwoMassModelAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/02-TwoMassModelAnalysis.md)`), `[TriangularGlottis.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/TriangularGlottis.h)` (documented in `[03-TriangularGlottisAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/03-TriangularGlottisAnalysis.md)`), `GeometricGlottis.h` (pending analysis), and base `Glottis.h` (pending analysis).
    *   These define声源模型 for voice synthesis.
    *   **Relevance & Decision**: Essential for speech synthesis with `Acoustic3dSimulation`. Restored/Retained.

*   **Signal Analysis Tools (Restored/Retained per user decision)**:
    *   `[F0EstimatorYin.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/F0EstimatorYin.h)`: For F0 estimation. Documented in `[04-F0EstimatorYinAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/04-F0EstimatorYinAnalysis.md)`.
    *   `[VoiceQualityEstimator.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VoiceQualityEstimator.h)`: For voice quality estimation. Documented in `[05-VoiceQualityEstimatorAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/05-VoiceQualityEstimatorAnalysis.md)`.
    *   **Current Status**: User decided to retain these. Their `.h` and `.cpp` files were restored.

*   **TubeSequence Interface and Implementations (Restored/Retained, linked to `TdsModel`)**:
    *   `[TubeSequence.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/TubeSequence.h)`: Abstract interface for dynamic tube models. Documented in `[06-TubeSequenceAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/06-TubeSequenceAnalysis.md)`.
    *   `[StaticPhone.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/StaticPhone.h)`: Implementation for static phonemes. Documented in `[10-StaticPhoneAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/10-StaticPhoneAnalysis.md)`.
    *   `[VowelLf.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/VowelLf.h)`: Implementation for LF-source based vowels. Documented in `[07-VowelLfAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/07-VowelLfAnalysis.md)`.
    *   `[ImpulseExcitation.h](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/Backend/ImpulseExcitation.h)`: Implementation for impulse response analysis. Documented in `[08-ImpulseExcitationAnalysis.md](mdc:miniVTL3D/sources/doc/08-ImpulseExcitationAnalysis.md)`.
    *   **Relevance & Decision**: Primarily serve `TdsModel`. Since `TdsModel` is currently retained, these are also restored. If `TdsModel` is later removed, these can likely be removed too.

## Key Takeaways:

*   **Start with High-Level Integrators**: `MainWindow` and `Application` are good starting points.
*   **Header Includes are Key**: Commenting out the target module's header in its primary users is a good first step to reveal direct dependencies.
*   **Iterative Compilation is Your Friend**: Compile frequently after sets of changes. Compiler errors are guides.
*   **Follow the Dependency Chain**: Removing one piece of code will often show what other code depended on it.
*   **`.h` and `.cpp` Synchronization**: Ensure that if a function declaration is removed/commented in a `.h` file, its definition in the corresponding `.cpp` file is also removed/commented, and vice-versa.
*   **Event Tables and ID Definitions**: Don't forget to clean up event table entries and associated ID constants in `.cpp` files.
*   **Clean Builds**: After significant code removal and successful compilation via commenting, always perform a clean build after updating the actual build system files to ensure old object files aren't causing issues.
